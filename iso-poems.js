two lights orbit in the dark.
Two broken mirrors, fused at the edges,
silver their cracks and mend what they can.

I search for you in everything,
exhaling you into rooms I can't find you,
so I'm not without you
a breath longer than I have to be.`

        content: `I have tried everything
that I could think of,
trying to forget you.

An astronomer cannot forget the stars.
A poet cannot forget the scars.
And a keeper cannot forget the heart.`

        author: "iso",
        content: `A lantern swings through catacomb air.
Each flame a life, each life a prayer.
I count them down to number none.
Yet still they burn, yet still they run.

Carry my ghost across the sea,
the light you lost still follows me.

The sun knelt low, ashamed of day.
The moon betrayed her borrowed gray.
And I, the sinner, praised the scar,
for even dark remembers stars.

Carry my ghost across the sea,
the light you lost still follows me.`
